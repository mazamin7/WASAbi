# WASAbi - a Wave-based Acoustic Simulator using ARD

C++ implementation of Adaptive Rectangular Decomposition (ARD) with frequency dependent atmospheric absorption in 2.5D (3D with constant height).

## Input data
`assets/*.txt` records the structure of room on x-y plane. Note that this simulator only supports 2.5D room geometries: z should always be 0 and depth of all partition should be equal.

Input example:

partition:
```
0 0 0 3 3 3  <- partition 0: x, y, z, width, height, depth
3 0 0 3 3 3  <- partition 1: x, y, z, width, height, depth

```
source:
```
1 1 1 <- source 0: x, y, z

```

recorder:
```
1 1 1 <- recorder 0: x, y, z

```

All the values above are in real world scale (meter).

**Don't forget to add an extra blank line at the end of file.**

## Features

- Frequency dependent atmospheric absorption
- Partial absorbing boundaries through PML partitions
- Test cases included

## Building and running

Use Visual Studio to build. The solution itself is self-contained, so simply building and running in Visual Studio should work. Win32 mode may cause performance issue, please run under x64 mode.
